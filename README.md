# Abstract Interactive Canvas

This project is a simple interactive particle animation that runs in a web browser. It showcases particles that move dynamically on a canvas and respond to user input.

## Features

- **Dynamic Particle Movement:** Particles move across the canvas in random patterns.
- **Edge Bouncing:** Particles bounce off the edges of the screen, staying within the visible area.
- **Mouse and Touch Interaction:** Particles react to mouse movements and touch input, generally moving away from the cursor or touch point.
- **Reset Functionality:** A "Reset" button allows users to reinitialize the particles to their starting random positions.

## TODO

Here's a list of potential improvements and new features that could be added to this project:

- **Customization Options:**
    - Allow users to control the number of particles.
    - Let users adjust particle speed.
    - Enable customization of particle size.
    - Offer options for particle color palettes or individual color selection.
    - Allow users to modify the strength of interaction with the mouse/touch.
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - Investigate and implement optimizations to ensure smooth animation, especially with a larger number of particles.
- **Interaction Modes:**
    - Introduce different ways particles interact with input (e.g., attract to cursor, form specific shapes or patterns).
- **Graphical Effects & Enhancements:**
    - Implement particle trails for a visual history of movement.
    - Add color cycling effects or dynamic color changes based on interactions.
    - Explore shape morphing or particle merging/splitting behaviors.
    - Investigate post-processing effects like bloom, motion blur, or scan lines for a richer visual experience.
    - Allow particles to be different shapes (e.g., squares, triangles, lines) instead of just circles.
    - Add an option for particles to leave a fading trail.
    - Implement a "gravity" mode where particles are pulled towards a certain point or line.
    - Add "connector lines" between nearby particles.
- **Background Customization:**
    - Allow users to change the background color.
    - Implement functionality to use an image as the background.
- **Mobile Experience:**
    - Further enhance touch handling for a more intuitive experience on mobile devices.
    - Ensure the UI is fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens.
- **Code Quality:**
    - Refactor the JavaScript code into a separate `.js` file for better organization.
    - Consider using JavaScript modules to improve code structure and maintainability.
